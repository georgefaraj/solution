 *   scheduler_submkt() : submit (or resubmit) a request to the scheduler
 *   schdeduler_get_next() : gets the next request to service
 *
 * The scheduler_init() function should be called once, at the start of the 
 * program.  This function will set which scheduler to use.
 *
 * The scheduler_submit() function should be called when a new job is to be
 * be added to the ready queue.  This function takes a pointer to an RCB and
 * adds it to the appropriate queue.
 *
 * The scheduler_get_next() function removes the next RCB from the ready queue
 * and returns a pointer to it.  If the queue is empty, NULL is returned.
